# Privacy Policy Screen Implementation

## 📋 **Overview**

I've implemented a beautiful, mandatory privacy policy screen that appears only on the first app launch. Users must accept the privacy policy to continue using the Laennec AI Health Assistant app.

## 🏗️ **Implementation Structure**

### **Files Created/Modified:**

#### **1. Privacy Policy Screen (`lib/screens/privacy_policy_screen.dart`)**
```dart
class PrivacyPolicyScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  // Beautiful animated UI with scrollable content
  // Fixed bottom buttons (Agree/Disagree)
  // Haptic feedback and smooth transitions
}
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Animated header with app icon
- ✅ Scrollable privacy policy text in styled container
- ✅ Fixed bottom buttons with proper styling
- ✅ Confirmation dialog for disagree action
- ✅ Smooth page transitions

#### **2. First Launch Checker (`lib/utils/first_launch_checker.dart`)**
```dart
class FirstLaunchChecker {
  static Future<bool> hasAcceptedPrivacyPolicy()
  static Future<bool> isFirstLaunch()
  static Future<void> markPrivacyPolicyAccepted()
  static Future<void> markFirstLaunchCompleted()
  static Future<void> resetPreferences() // For testing
}
```

**Purpose:**
- ✅ Manages first launch detection
- ✅ Tracks privacy policy acceptance
- ✅ Provides testing utilities
- ✅ Uses SharedPreferences for persistence

#### **3. App Launcher (`lib/main.dart`)**
```dart
class AppLauncher extends StatefulWidget {
  // Checks privacy policy status on startup
  // Routes to privacy screen or splash screen accordingly
}
```

**Flow:**
1. **App Starts** → Shows loading screen
2. **Check Preferences** → Has user accepted privacy policy?
3. **Route Decision:**
   - ✅ **Accepted** → Go to SplashScreen
   - ❌ **Not Accepted** → Show PrivacyPolicyScreen

#### **4. Debug Screen (`lib/screens/debug_screen.dart`)**
```dart
class DebugScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  // Testing utilities for privacy policy functionality
}
```

**Debug Features:**
- ✅ View current privacy policy status
- ✅ Reset preferences for testing
- ✅ Direct access to privacy policy screen
- ✅ Refresh status display

## 🎯 **User Flow**

### **First Time User:**
1. **App Launch** → Loading screen appears
2. **Privacy Policy** → Beautiful privacy screen with scrollable content
3. **User Choice:**
   - **Agree** → Saves preference → Goes to SplashScreen → Normal app flow
   - **Disagree** → Confirmation dialog → App exits

### **Returning User:**
1. **App Launch** → Loading screen appears
2. **Check Saved Preference** → Privacy already accepted
3. **Direct to SplashScreen** → Normal app flow (no privacy screen)

2. Tap "Reset Privacy Preferences"
3. Close and restart the app
4. Privacy policy should appear

### **Method 2: Manual Testing**
1. Uninstall and reinstall the app
2. Privacy policy should appear on first launch
3. Test both "Agree" and "Disagree" buttons

### **Method 3: Code Testing**
```dart
// Reset preferences programmatically
await FirstLaunchChecker.resetPreferences();
// Restart app to test
```
